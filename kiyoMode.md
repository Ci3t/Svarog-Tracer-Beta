🌊 **WAVE THEORY MASTERCLASS: How to Hit Flips Like a Pro**

---

## 📚 **FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS**

### **What Are Waves?**

Waves are **patterns in how the last 2 digits behave**. Think of them like ocean waves - they build up momentum, then crash and flip to the opposite side.

### **The 3 Columns You Track:**

1. **Column 2** (Middle digit): **Outer [1,4]** vs **Inner [2,3]**
2. **Column 3** (Last digit): **Low [1,2]** vs **High [3,4]**

_(Column 1 is ignored - it's just which line the relic lands on, completely random)_

### **Example Translation:**

```
RAW:  112  →  TRANSLATED: 441
      ^^^                   ^^^
      We only care about: ^^ (last 2 digits = 41)
```

---

## 🎯 **THE CORE STRATEGY: 3-Step Decision Process**

### **STEP 1: Check Swap Rate (Reliability Indicator)**

This tells you **HOW PREDICTABLE** the column is:

| Swap Rate  | Meaning                                     | Trust Level                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **< 30%**  | 🔒 **STICKY** - Pattern holds for long runs | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **MAXIMUM TRUST** |
| **30-40%** | 🔒 **Sticky** - Generally stable            | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **High Trust**      |
| **40-60%** | ⚡ **MODERATE** - Changes regularly         | ⭐⭐⭐ **Medium Trust**      |
| **60-70%** | 🌊 **VOLATILE** - Flips often               | ⭐⭐ **Low Trust**           |
| **≥ 70%**  | 🚫 **CHAOTIC** - Ignore this column         | ⭐ **Don't Trust**           |

**Why This Matters:**

- **Sticky columns** = Flip predictions are GOLD 💰
- **Volatile columns** = Too unpredictable, skip them

---

### **STEP 2: Check Run Length (Flip Trigger)**

This tells you **WHEN the flip is coming**:

| Run Length         | Status                  | Confidence | Action                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **5+ consecutive** | 🔴 **FLIP VERY LIKELY** | 80-85%     | BET GOOD RELICS ✅                 |
| **4 consecutive**  | 🟠 **FLIP LIKELY**      | 70-75%     | BET OKAY RELICS ✅                 |
| **3 consecutive**  | 🟡 **FLIP POSSIBLE**    | 65-70%     | BET TRASH or SKIP                  |
| **2 consecutive**  | ⚪ **UNCERTAIN**        | 55-60%     | SKIP (unless volatile - see below) |
| **1 or less**      | 🔵 **MAY CONTINUE**     | 50-52%     | SKIP                               |

**Special Case - Volatile Columns:**

- If a volatile column (swap rate > 50%) hits **2 consecutive**, the system **upgrades confidence to 75%** 🧠
- This is adaptive learning - it knows this column flips early!

---

### **STEP 3: Combine Swap Rate + Run Length**

This is where the magic happens! 🪄

#### **🏆 TIER S: BET GOOD RELICS (75-85% confidence)**

**Scenario 1: The Golden Pattern**

```
✅ Sticky (<30%) + 5+ Run = 80-85% confidence
Example:
  Column 3: 5 consecutive High
  Swap Rate: 20% (Sticky)
  → FLIP TO LOW is 80% likely ✅ BET YOUR BEST RELICS
```

**Scenario 2: Wave + Prefix Aligned**

```
✅ Wave predicts: 423 (Low)
✅ Prefix predicts: 422 (Low)
→ Both agree on Low = 80-90% confidence ✅ BET GOOD RELICS
```

---

#### **⚡ TIER A: BET OKAY RELICS (60-70% confidence)**

**Scenario: Moderate Sticky + Good Run**

```
✅ Swap Rate: 40% (Moderate)
✅ Run Length: 3-4 consecutive
→ 65-70% confidence ✅ BET DECENT RELICS
```

---

#### **🚫 TIER B: SKIP OR BET TRASH (45-60% confidence)**

**When to Skip:**

- Swap Rate ≥ 70% (too volatile)
- Run Length = 1-2 (too early)
- Wave conflicts with Prefix AND swap rate > 50%

---

## 🧠 **ADAPTIVE LEARNING FEATURE**

The system **learns from your data**:

### **Example: Volatile Column Detection**

```
Your last 20 rolls show Column 3:
HH-LL-HH-LL-HH-LL-HH-LL
   ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
   Flips after just 2!

System calculates:
  Flip-at-2 Rate: 60%
  Behavior: VOLATILE

Result:
  When Column 3 hits 2 consecutive High:
  → Confidence upgraded to 75% (was 55%) 🧠
  → Predicts flip to Low with HIGH confidence
```

---

## 🎮 **REAL GAMEPLAY SCENARIOS**

### **🟢 Scenario 1: The Perfect Setup (BET HEAVY)**

```
📊 Your Current Pattern:
   Last 6 rolls: 444, 443, 444, 441, 444, 443
                   ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑
               High High High High High High

🔍 Analysis:
   Column 3: 6 consecutive High
   Swap Rate: 25% (Sticky 🔒)
   Run Length: 6 🔴

✅ DECISION:
   Flip to LOW is 85% likely
   Prediction: 421 or 422 (Low)
   Action: BET YOUR BEST RELICS 💎
```

---

### **🟡 Scenario 2: Conflict Resolution (BE CAREFUL)**

```
📊 Wave Analysis:
   Column 3: 4 consecutive High
   Swap Rate: 35% (Sticky)
   Wave predicts: 421 (Low) - 75% confidence

📊 Smart Prefix:
   Prefix "44" historically → 443 (High) - 60% confidence

⚠️ CONFLICT DETECTED!

🔍 Decision Tree:
   1️⃣ Check swap rate: 35% (Sticky) ✅
   2️⃣ Check run length: 4 (Strong) ✅
   3️⃣ Sticky + Long Run beats prefix!

✅ FINAL DECISION:
   TRUST THE WAVE → Predict 421 (Low)
   Effective Confidence: 70%
   Action: BET OKAY RELICS (not your best, but good ones)
```

---

### **🔴 Scenario 3: Skip This (TOO RISKY)**

```
📊 Analysis:
   Column 2: 2 consecutive Outer
   Column 3: 2 consecutive High
   Avg Swap Rate: 72% (VOLATILE 🌊)

🚫 DECISION:
   Swap rate too high = Unreliable patterns
   Run lengths too short = No clear trigger
   Prefix prediction: 441 - 55% confidence

✅ FINAL DECISION:
   SKIP or BET TRASH ONLY
   Wait for better setup
```

```

---

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

### **1. The Patience Rule**

```
❌ BAD: Betting on every prediction
✅ GOOD: Waiting for Sticky + Long Run setups

Only ~20-30% of predictions are Tier S/A.
Wait for the golden moments! 💎
```

### **2. The Alignment Boost**

```
When Wave and Prefix agree:
  Base: 70% + 75% = 72.5% avg
  Aligned Boost: 72.5% × 1.25 = 90% 🚀
```

### **3. The Post-Flip Cooldown**

```
After a 5-run flips:
  System detects: "JUST FLIPPED" 🟣
  Recommendation: SKIP next 2-3 rolls
  Why: Patterns reset after major flips
```

### **4. The Adaptive Advantage**

```
Your Column 3 flips at 2 more than average?
  System learns this 🧠
  Upgrades 2-run from 55% → 75%
  Result: You catch flips others miss!
```

---

## 📖 **SUMMARY: THE 3 GOLDEN RULES**

### **🥇 RULE 1: STICKY + LONG RUN = TRUST WAVE**

```
Swap Rate < 30% + Run ≥ 4 = BET GOOD RELICS ✅
This is your money maker!
```

### **🥈 RULE 2: ALIGNMENT = MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE**

```
Wave + Prefix agree = 80-90% confidence
Both predictions point same direction = BET HEAVY ✅
```

### **🥉 RULE 3: VOLATILE = SKIP OR TRUST PREFIX**

```
Swap Rate ≥ 70% = Wave unreliable
Stick to prefix predictions (55-65%) or skip 🚫
```

---

## 🎓 **FINAL EXAM: Test Your Understanding**

### **Question:**

```
Column 3: 5 consecutive High
Swap Rate: 22%
Prefix predicts: 444 (High)
Wave predicts: 421 (Low)

What do you do?
```

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>

**✅ TRUST THE WAVE → Predict Low (421 or 422)**

**Reasoning:**

1. Swap Rate 22% = STICKY 🔒 (maximum reliability)
2. Run Length 5 = CRITICAL 🔴 (80-85% flip confidence)
3. Sticky + Long Run **BEATS** prefix (Rule #1)
4. Effective Confidence: **80%**
5. Action: **BET GOOD RELICS** 💎

**Even though prefix conflicts, the wave pattern is TOO STRONG to ignore!**

</details>

---

## 🚀 **NEXT LEVEL: Reading the UI**

### **What to Look For:**

1. **Wave Analysis Panel**

   - Look for 🔒 icons = Sticky columns (your friends!)
   - Avoid 🚫 icons = Volatile columns (skip these)

2. **Run Length Display**

   - 🔴 5+ = BET NOW
   - 🟠 4 = BET OKAY RELICS
   - 🟡 3 = CAUTIOUS
   - ⚪ 2 = SKIP (unless adaptive note shows flip-at-2)

3. **Adaptive Notes**

   - 🧠 "64% flip at 2 historically" = Trust 2-run for this column
   - System learned YOUR specific pattern!

4. **Conflict Resolution**
   - "TRUST WAVE - Highest reliability" = Wave wins
   - "TRUST PREFIX - Wave too volatile" = Prefix wins
   - "CONSIDER BOTH" = Use caution, bet small

---

**You're now a Wave Theory expert! 🌊🏆**

The key is **patience** - wait for those Sticky + Long Run setups, and you'll hit flips like a master! 💎

**Why This Matters:**
- **Sticky columns** = Flip predictions are GOLD 💰
- **Volatile columns** = Too unpredictable, skip them

### STEP 2: Check Run Length (Flip Trigger)

| **5+ consecutive** | 🔴 **FLIP VERY LIKELY** | 80-85% | BET GOOD RELICS ✅ |
| **4 consecutive** | 🟠 **FLIP LIKELY** | 70-75% | BET OKAY RELICS ✅ |
| **3 consecutive** | 🟡 **FLIP POSSIBLE** | 65-70% | BET TRASH or SKIP |
| **2 consecutive** | ⚪ **UNCERTAIN** | 55-60% | SKIP (unless volatile - see below) |
| **1 or less** | 🔵 **MAY CONTINUE** | 50-52% | SKIP |

**Special Case - Volatile Columns:**

- Sticky (<30%) + 5+ Run = 80-85%
- Sticky (<40%) + 4+ Run = 75-80%
- Wave + Prefix Aligned (1+ flip col) = 80%

### Tier A (60-70% confidence)
- Moderate (<50%) + 3+ Run = 65-70%
- Moderate compound + 1 sticky col = 60%
- High prefix conf (65%+) + Low volatility (<60%) = 65%

### Tier B (45-60% confidence)
- High volatility (≥60%) = Downgraded to 45-55%
