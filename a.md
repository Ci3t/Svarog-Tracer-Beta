## 🧠 What is Smart Prefix?

Smart Prefix is the **pattern-based prediction system** that works alongside Wave Theory. It analyzes historical data to predict what comes next based on the first 2 digits of a roll.

### How It Works

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Looks at the **first 2 digits** of recent rolls (e.g., "41", "42", "43")
- Predicts the **3rd digit** based on historical frequency
- Example: If "41" appeared 10 times in history, and 6 times it was "411", then "411" gets priority

**Intelligent Data Blending:**
- **Live Data (70%)**: Your current session patterns get priority
- **EU Training Data (30%)**: Historical EU server data as backup
- When you have **5+ matches** in your session, live patterns dominate
- When you have **fewer matches**, training data fills the gaps

**Live vs Training:**
- 🟢 **Strong Live** (5+ matches): 70% live + 30% training
- 🟡 **Moderate Live** (2-4 matches): 60% live + 40% training
- 🔵 **Training Only** (<2 matches): 100% training data

### When to Use Smart Prefix

✅ **Use Smart Prefix When:**
- No strong wave patterns exist (0 flip columns)
- Wave is too volatile (swap rate ≥70%)
- Early in your session (fewer than 10 rolls)
- Balanced columns with no clear direction

⚠️ **Use as Backup When:**
- Wave and Prefix conflict
- Moderate confidence scenarios
- You want a second opinion

### Confidence Boosting: The Magic of Alignment

When Smart Prefix **aligns with Wave predictions**, confidence increases by **+20-25%**:

**Example:**
- Wave predicts: **"Inner"** (digits 2 or 3) — 70% confidence
- Prefix predicts: **"412"** (digit 2 = Inner) — 65% confidence
- **ALIGNED!** → Confidence jumps to **85-90%** ✅

This is the **ideal scenario** — both systems agree, giving you maximum confidence!

### Priority Order (When Prefix is Selected)

1. **Live Typing** — As you type in Test Rolls, it predicts in real-time
2. **Manual Selection** — Click a prefix button to force analysis
3. **Auto-Detection** — Uses the last roll's prefix automatically

### Real-World Usage

**Scenario 1: No Wave Pattern**
```
- Column 2: 50% swap (Moderate)
- Column 3: 55% swap (Moderate)
- Focus: None (no clear flip)
→ TRUST SMART PREFIX (only reliable signal)
```

**Scenario 2: Wave + Prefix Aligned**
```
- Wave: Column 3 flip to "Low" (1/2) — 72% confidence
- Prefix: Predicts "412" (digit 2 = Low) — 68% confidence
→ ALIGNED! Confidence → 85-90% (BET GOOD RELICS)
```

**Scenario 3: Wave + Prefix Conflict**
```
- Wave: Column 2 flip to "Inner" (2/3) — 67% confidence, 25% swap
- Prefix: Predicts "414" (digit 4 = Outer) — 70% confidence
→ Wave is sticky (<30% swap) → TRUST WAVE over prefix
```

### Key Takeaways

- 📊 **Smart Prefix = Pattern frequency analysis** (first 2 digits predict 3rd)
- 🎯 **Best used when waves are unclear** (balanced or volatile)
- ⚡ **Alignment is powerful** (+20-25% confidence boost)
- 🧪 **Live data adapts to your session** (learns your unique patterns)
- 🔄 **Blends training + live** for balanced predictions

## 🎯 Smart Prefix vs Wave Theory

| Feature | Smart Prefix | Wave Theory |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **What it analyzes** | First 2 digits → 3rd digit | Column patterns (Outer/Inner, Low/High) |
| **Data source** | Live + EU training data | Live session only |
| **Best for** | No clear waves, early game | Sticky patterns, long runs |
| **Confidence range** | 45-70% (alone) | 60-85% (with strong wave) |
| **When aligned** | 80-90% confidence 🔥 | Maximum reliability |

**The Golden Rule:** When both agree, bet with confidence. When they conflict, check swap rates and run lengths to decide.
